# BitDrones
### Welcome to the ```master``` branch of BitDrones' Repo !
__Own your drones! But why?__    
1. Weapon! Attack the target;
2. Transporter! Move the items and blocks;
3. Vehicle! Make everything flyable;
4. Explorer! Draw maps or scout the enemy mobs;
5. Camera! Take a selfie with your friend!
6. Miner! Mine the tunnel and even find the diamond;
7. Builder! Build your structure by using blue prints.

This mod is inspired by the CustomDrones (I do maintain CustomDrones).
